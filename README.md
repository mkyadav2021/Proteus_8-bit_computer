A brief report about the project can be found in "**8 bit computer_report**".

For this project, I took inspiration from Ben Eater's "**8-bit computer from scratch**". While Ben demonstrates how to build the computer on a breadboard using ICs and real hardware, I implemented it in Proteus using mostly the same chips, except for few, such as ROM chips. For ROM chips, I used an alternative IC. Since the Arduino-based method was writing to ROM was not viable in my case, I manually entererd data into each memory location and then uploaded the .hex file to ROMs.
